In order to enable advanced branding through the code editor, you would need to [configure an custom domain](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/settings/settings-configure-custom-url.htm) using a domain that you own.\n\nIn the next lab, you will use Okta APIs to manage brands and themes."
